<p> Hello friends! Welcome to a sad excuse for a website attempt. Here, you will find a format so bad that all your self esteem issues will disappear! Since this is an about page, you clearly want to learn some not-so-interesting facts about me. Hopefully this doesn't end up reading like an online dating profile.

<p> Robotics is of the few school related activities I thouroughly enjoy, the listening and creation of the substance knonwn as "music" keeps me sane 74% of the time, and blade is life. No, not blade as in knife. Blade as in rollerblades, you uncultered swine. I know that's what you were thinking and you shan't make me think otherwise. I digress. I'm probably 5'1, I somehow managed to become a senior, I think my hair is cool so haters BACK OFF, and I'm 71 years old. Wow, this really is a dating profile.
